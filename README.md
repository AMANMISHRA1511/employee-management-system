This Django app is responsible for all user-related authentication and authorization features.

## Purpose

-   Handles user registration, login, and logout.

-   Implements Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using `django-otp`.

-   **`models.py`**: (Optional) If a custom user model is used, it will be defined here. Otherwise, it relies on Django's default `User` model.
-   **`forms.py`**: Defines the forms for user registration, login, and password reset.
-   **`urls.py`**: Contains the URL patterns for all authentication endpoints.
